# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to reduce lag during scrolling and improve overall user experience.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Particles Configuration Optimization
- **Reduced particle count**: From 120 to 60 particles
- **Lowered FPS limit**: From 60 to 30 FPS
- **Disabled heavy features**: 
  - Click interactions
  - Hover interactions
  - Triangle shapes
  - Attraction forces
  - Twinkle effects
  - Retina detection
- **Simplified animations**: Disabled opacity and size animations
- **Reduced movement speed**: Slower particle movement for better performance

### 2. React Component Optimizations
- **React.memo**: Added to all major components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Reduced animation complexity**: 
  - Shorter animation durations (0.6s → 0.5s)
  - Smaller movement distances (50px → 30px)
  - Reduced hover effects
- **Optimized viewport triggers**: Added margins to reduce premature animations
- **useMemo**: Used for expensive calculations

### 3. CSS Performance Optimizations
- **Hardware acceleration**: Added `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU acceleration
- **Will-change properties**: Added for animations, blur effects, and gradients
- **Reduced motion support**: Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- **Mobile optimizations**: Reduced blur effects and animation durations on mobile
- **Font rendering**: Optimized with `-webkit-font-smoothing` and `text-rendering`

### 4. Build Optimizations
- **Code splitting**: Manual chunks for vendor libraries
- **Tree shaking**: Optimized dependencies
- **Minification**: Terser for better compression
- **Target optimization**: ESnext for modern browsers

### 5. Animation Optimizations
- **Reduced gradient overlays**: From 5 to 3 animated elements
- **Smaller blur effects**: Reduced from 3xl to 2xl
- **Lower opacity values**: Reduced from 20% to 10%
- **Shorter animation delays**: Reduced from 0.2s to 0.1s intervals

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- **FPS Monitor**: Development-only performance tracking
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Ctrl+Shift+P to toggle performance monitor
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows current FPS and performance status

## Performance Hooks

### useMobile()
Detects mobile devices and can be used to disable heavy animations on mobile.

### useReducedMotion()
Detects user's motion preference and disables animations accordingly.

### PerformanceWrapper
A wrapper component that conditionally renders animations based on device capabilities and user preferences.

## Usage Tips

### For Development
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to toggle the performance monitor
2. Monitor FPS during scrolling
3. Aim for 50+ FPS for optimal performance

### For Production
1. Build with `npm run build` for optimized production bundle
2. Test on various devices and connection speeds
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

### Further Optimizations
1. **Lazy loading**: Consider lazy loading sections that are not immediately visible
2. **Virtual scrolling**: For large lists, implement virtual scrolling
3. **Image optimization**: Use WebP format and proper sizing
4. **CDN**: Serve static assets from a CDN
5. **Service Worker**: Implement caching strategies

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Hardware acceleration recommended
- Touch devices optimized for mobile performance

## Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60 FPS during smooth scrolling
- **Mobile**: 30+ FPS during smooth scrolling
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1

## Monitoring
Use the built-in performance monitor or browser DevTools to track:
- FPS during scrolling
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Network requests

## Troubleshooting
If performance issues persist:
1. Check if particles are disabled on mobile
2. Verify reduced motion preferences
3. Monitor memory usage for leaks
4. Test with different devices and browsers
